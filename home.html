            <p>Dreamcatcher members are not just recent names in the industry. Before Dreamcatcher, 5 of the members were part of another group <em>MINX</em>, under the same company(known as Happyface Ent.) <br></p>
            <div class="img-holder"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/images/minx-grp.jpeg" alt="minx"></div>
            <p>MINX consisted of the members: Jiu, Sua, Siyeon, Yoohyeon and Dami. It had a completely different type of sound. MINX was a cute concept girlgroup with sweet songs about fun and love. MINX debuted on September 18, 2014 with the title track <a href="https://youtu.be/wqiEAod0LYI?si=zmYh4C6ki6Kslajk">"Why Did You Come To My Home"</a> but they could not manage to chart well in the kpop market at that time.
            MINX cameback again and released their first album on July 2, 2015 with the title track <a href="https://youtu.be/iLXyoC2HRgY?si=6KxwZpjBeRMWqeU3">"Love Shake"</a> but it also was not that successful. Even though MINX had some great songs as title track and B-sides but because of not getting enough attention ultimately MINX disbanded on November 29, 2016.</p>
